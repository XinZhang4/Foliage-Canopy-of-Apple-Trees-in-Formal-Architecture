This is a set of image/label (MATLAB-based gTruth) data of foliage canopy of apple trees in formal architecture.
Images/labels could be used for (semantic segmentation-based) deep learning for objects indentification (e.g., trunks, branches, apples, etc.)
Images were acquired in 2018 apple harvesting season near Prosser, WA (USA) using Kinect V2 sensor (with background removed).
The apple cultivars include: Fuji (674 images), Envy (58 images), Scifresh (38 images), and Pink Lady (15 images).
